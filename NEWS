0.5.2:

This patch release includes several fixes of bugs that were discovered while
testing slibtool as the primary libtool in a pkgsrc comprehensive build. In
addition, the release includes several improvements to slibtool's own build
system.

- link mode: legabits: generate a perfectly compatible wrapper.
- install mode: legabits: install a perfectly compatible wrapper.
- project: by default, slibtool is now an application-only package.
- build system: added support of --disable-shared and --disable-static.
- build system: added support of --all-shared and --all-static.
- build system: properly handle user inclusion of -static in LDFLAGS.

0.5.1:

This patch release includes several small fixes, as well as the addition of
an optional (opt-in at runtime) yet important compatibility feature, namely
the installation of .la wrappers. Changes in this release include:

- driver: added --legabits support.
- install mode: optional installation of .la wrappers.
- project: added compatibility symlinks (clibtool, clibtool-[shared|static])
- build system: removed the endian.h test.
- build system: proper use of any-os.mk.

0.5.0:

This is the first tagged release of slibtool. It is the result of two months of
intensive development, and follows rigorous testing on several systems. As of
this initial release, slibtool is known to successfully build an entire Exherbo
Linux system from source, build the midipix cross compilation toolchain from
source, and likewise build many other packages.

Support for the ELF/default host flavor is complete, and does not appear to have
any errors. Support for the PE/midipix flavor is also complete, and includes not
only static archives and shared libraries, but also import libraries with
version support. Support for the Darwin host flavor already exists too, yet it
is currently semantically incorrect, and so will be fixed in the next release.
